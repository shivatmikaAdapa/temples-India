        <p class="align">History says that Badrinath Temple was originally established by Adi Sankaracharya in the ninth century. Adi Sankara is an extraordinary scholar and Indian theologist, who took Sanyas (brahmacharyam) at a young age of 14. After that the temple has undergone many renovations. The King of Garhwal moved the idol to the present temple in the sixteenth century. After the Himalayan earthquake in 1803, the temple experienced significant damage and was rebuilt by the King of Jaipur. Badrinath temple is one of the five holy places (Punyakshetras) of India, where the Hindus offer oblation to their ancestors.

            There are several legends associated with the Badrinath temple, which is also mentioned in Vedic texts.
            
            One legend says that Lord Vishnu went into deep meditation in Padmasana in this region. Due to this, he was unaware of the extreme climatic condition and his consort Lakshmi spread above him as a Badri tree to protect him from the harsh weather. Lord Vishnu was pleased with her and named the place as Badrikashram afterGoddess Lakshmi. Complying with this legend, one can find the deity in Padmasana posture in Badrinath temple.</p>
